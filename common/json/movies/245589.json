For believers and skeptics alike, there is nothing in this world or the next to rival the relentless evil of a Voodoo Possession. Burdened since childhood with a gnawing sense of guilt, cynical Aiden Chase journeys to a Haitian insane asylum in search of his missing brother. Upon arriving, he discovers all the inmates and the hospital administrator (Danny Trejo, Machete) are seemingly possessed by a bloodthirsty voodoo spirit. Now, Aiden must abandon reality and descend into a terrifying spirit world to try to rescue his brother - or they will both be damned for eternity.","popularity":2.7632295906123,"poster_path":"/pJKEFRDKH24ahbkuEQgcFT6rDiH.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"B2FX","id":18926},{"name":"Front Row Media","id":18927},{"name":"Front Row Productions","id":18928},{"name":"Rough Riders Studios","id":18929},{"name":"Waltertainment","id":18930}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Voodoo Possession","vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1,"trailers":{"quicktime":[],"youtube":[{"name":"Trailer","size":"HD","source":"CMSDNmWGQQE","type":"Trailer"}]}}
