Keanu Reeves leads the cast as Kai, an outcast who joins Oishi (Hiroyuki Sanada), the leader of the 47 outcast samurai.  Together they seek vengeance upon the treacherous overlord who killed their master and banished their kind.  To restore honor to their homeland, the warriors embark upon a quest that challenges them with a series of trials that would destroy ordinary warriors.  47 Ronin is helmed by visionary director Carl Erik Rinsch (The Gift).  Inspired by styles as diverse as Miyazaki and Hokusai, Rinsch will bring to life the stunning landscapes and enormous battles that will display the timeless Ronin story to global audiences in a way that’s never been seen before.","popularity":"29.0364446464798","poster_path":"/2otPirPWbW56rAydNOFh8AWrOwm.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Universal Pictures","id":33}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"This Christmas, seize eternity.","title":"47 Ronin","vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":30,"trailers":{"quicktime":[],"youtube":[{"name":"Trailer 1","size":"HD","source":"j8cKdDkkIYY","type":"Trailer"}]}}
